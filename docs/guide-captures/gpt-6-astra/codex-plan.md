# Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

How to access and get started with Codex

This article covers Codex, OpenAI's coding agent. If you're interested in ChatGPT Work, a separate ChatGPT experience for longer research and deliverable tasks, see ChatGPT Work and Codex; for technical Codex details, see the Codex page on our developers site. Codex is included across ChatGPT plans. For information on ChatGPT features such as Sora, ChatGPT Images, or Voice mode, please refer to other articles in our Help Center. Learn more about ChatGPT Voice —including ordinary Chat Voice and Voice in Work and Codex on desktop.

# What is Codex?

Codex is an AI agent that helps you write, review, and ship code.

# Getting started

## How to connect Codex with your ChatGPT account

To start using Codex with your ChatGPT plan: Sign in with your ChatGPT account. Codex is included across ChatGPT plans, including Free and Go. Usage limits vary by plan. For more information, including higher-usage options for individuals and Codex credit plans for business users, visit chatgpt.com/pricing. Launch your preferred Codex client and follow the instructions to sign in with ChatGPT:

- ChatGPT desktop app (Codex mode)

- Codex CLI

- Codex IDE extension

- Codex web

- Follow the setup steps shown in the selected client.

## Use Codex on Windows

Codex on Windows includes these tools:

- Codex Doctor: Run codex doctor in the Codex CLI for diagnostics covering startup, connectivity, and performance issues.

- Remote Control: Control other devices from your Windows device. Workspace permissions and the device’s discovery and control settings still apply.

- WSL distribution selection: If you have multiple Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) distributions installed, choose which Linux distribution Codex uses.

If your organization manages app updates, your administrator needs to deploy the approved build through MDM before you can use features that require that build.

## What terms govern your use of Codex?

When you sign in to Codex using an existing ChatGPT account, the ChatGPT Terms of Use and Privacy Policy—or the corresponding online services agreement for OpenAI API and ChatGPT Enterprise, Education or Business Users—apply to data shared between Codex and ChatGPT.

## Enterprise setup and controls

### Model defaults for Codex

Workspace admins and owners can configure the starting model, reasoning level, speed, Fast Mode availability, and new-chat behavior for Codex from Workspace settings → Models (open Models). Fast Mode is enabled by default; where role-specific controls are available, admins can override the workspace default for selected roles. These settings define a member’s starting experience; they do not make unavailable models available or override enforced workspace requirements. When more than one setting applies, enforced controls take priority: managed requirements.toml requirements override workspace starting defaults, and workspace starting defaults override a member’s local starting choice. Members can switch away from a starting default only when the model remains available to them and no enforced requirement prevents the change.

### Setup

For an in-depth guide to get your workspace up and running with Codex, please refer to our guide here: Enterprise Admin Guide

### Plugins

The Plugins Directory is visible across ChatGPT plans. Whether a member can install or use a plugin depends on their plan, workspace settings, role, surface, and any app permissions the plugin requires. For Business and Enterprise/Edu workspaces, admins and owners manage plugin installation in Workspace settings > Plugins and underlying app access in Workspace settings > Apps. A plugin can include skills, apps, and app templates. If a plugin requires an app, that app must be enabled for the member's role before Codex can use the app-backed capability. Existing app settings continue to apply, including role access, action controls, approval settings, sync settings, domain restrictions, and provider authentication. Workspace plugin controls can choose whether a plugin is Available or Installed for eligible roles. Installed installs the plugin for that role by default; Available lets members install it themselves. These controls apply across ChatGPT web, ChatGPT mobile, ChatGPT desktop, and Codex when the plugin is available on that surface. Admins do not set a separate per-surface app or plugin toggle. Some local or Codex-specific plugins may be usable only in Codex. If a plugin was created locally, it may need to be uploaded, imported, or made available by an admin before it can be used by the broader workspace.

### Sites in Codex

Sites is available on paid ChatGPT plans except Free and Go in supported regions. Sites is not currently available in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom. Workspace admins control whether members can create Sites or publish them publicly. Where Sites is available in Codex, describe what you want to build, review the generated preview, and use the available sharing controls. For the full build and deployment workflow, see the Codex Sites developer guide. Workspace admins can control Sites creation and public publishing through the settings available to their plan.

- Available controls depend on plan and workspace configuration. If you cannot find the expected control, contact OpenAI Support.

### Developer mode for Browser use and in-app browser

Developer mode works with Browser use in Chrome and the Codex in-app browser. It gives Codex controlled access to Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) for deeper browser debugging, such as inspecting console output, network traffic, page state, and JavaScript performance. You can enable the feature locally in the ChatGPT desktop app by opening Settings > Browser and turning on Enable full CDP access under Developer mode. Full CDP access lets Codex inspect and control sensitive browser internals that may put your data at risk, and Codex asks for explicit approval before it uses full CDP access to inspect a website.

Users with permission to administer Codex can disable full CDP access from Managed configuration by setting browser_use_full_cdp_access to false. Disabling Browser use also disables CDP. For setup and approval details, see Developer mode. Note admins/owners will first need to enable the in-app browser before enabling developer mode.

### RBAC (Role-based access control)

Access to Codex is able to be granted to specific user roles. For more information on setting up RBAC, please refer to our guide here: RBAC

### Compliance API

Codex usage, including local clients such as the CLI and IDE extension as well as web or cloud-delegated usage, is available in the Compliance API. This log surface covers supported Codex clients, separate from cloud-task-specific endpoints.

# Usage limits by plan

If you’re nearing or have reached a Codex limit, open Settings or your usage dashboard. Check which allowance is exhausted, your credit balance, and any reset time shown. In an active Codex CLI session, enter /status.

For current limits, rates, and credit options, check the pricing page.

### Why usage can run out

Codex, ChatGPT Work, ChatGPT for Excel, and Workspace Agents use a shared allowance and credit pool when those features are available on your plan. Usage depends on the model, where the task runs, task complexity, context, reasoning, speed, and tools. A long-running task can use substantially more than a short request.

Task work started through ChatGPT Voice in Work or Codex on desktop uses that same allowance. Connected Voice time is metered separately where flexible pricing applies. Regular Chat Voice has separate limits and doesn’t consume Codex usage.

Where supported, ChatGPT Desktop shows credit usage for individual Work and Codex chats. Regular Chat usage isn’t included. Estimated dollar values appear only when your workspace enables member cost visibility. They’re planning estimates, not invoices.

Members of eligible Enterprise workspaces with credit-based billing can open Settings > Usage & billing in ChatGPT Desktop. This shows their monthly Work and Codex allowance and recent credit history. Where available, they can also review locally available high-usage Work and Codex chats and each chat’s lifetime credit usage. See Reviewing Work and Codex usage and using Personal Analytics for navigation, data freshness, and setup.

### What you can do next

Check the limit notice for the options available to your account. You may be able to add credits, use an available reset, upgrade, or wait until the displayed reset time. Eligible Plus and Pro users can buy credits without changing plans.

If purchased credits appear missing, first check that you’re in the correct account or workspace and review your recent usage. The credits guide also explains how a negative balance can affect a later purchase.

### If the numbers still look wrong

Contact OpenAI Support. Include the limit or credit balance you’re questioning, the reset time shown, a screenshot, the Codex client and model, and when it happened—including your time zone. Remove sensitive information from screenshots.

# Context and Data Controls

Some Codex features can make Codex more helpful by letting it remember context, continue work over time, and connect with tools you choose to use. These include Memories, Scheduled Tasks, Codex’s in-app browser, and Computer Use. For more information on these and other features, including how to manage the data that these features store and interact with, see our developer center.

## Record & Replay

Record & Replay is available in the ChatGPT desktop app while using Codex on macOS for eligible users. It lets you demonstrate a workflow once and turn it into a reusable skill. It is useful for stable, repeatable workflows that are easier to show than describe. Record & Replay requires Computer Use to be available and enabled, and initial availability excludes the European Union, Switzerland and the UK. During recording, Codex observes the actions and window content needed to learn the workflow. Keep recordings focused on the task, and avoid entering secrets or sensitive data during the recording. To learn more, see the Record & Replay guide.

## Data controls

Your ChatGPT training data controls apply to content processed through Codex, including screenshots taken by Computer Use. Local workflows run on your device; cloud tasks run in OpenAI-managed environments. Connected services may be available across supported ChatGPT and Codex surfaces, and you can disconnect them at any time.

# FAQ

## Which model does the Codex CLI or IDE extension use?

The model Codex uses by default will depend on your version of the CLI or IDE extension and configuration. Check out the Codex documentation for available models and how to configure different models.

## Does OpenAI train on my Codex usage?

### Business, Enterprise, and Edu

By default, OpenAI does not use any inputs or outputs from our products for business users, including ChatGPT Business, ChatGPT Enterprise, and the API, to improve our models. However, API organization owners can choose to opt-in to share API data with OpenAI. This setting is not available to certain organizations, including Enterprise and customers with Zero Data Retention enabled. Learn more about Sharing feedback, evaluation and fine-tuning data, and API inputs and outputs with OpenAI.

### Pro and Plus

Conversations may be used to improve models unless you turn off training in ChatGPT data controls. For more information, see how your data is used to improve model performance.

## Can I run Codex in my IDE?

Yes, the Codex VS Code extension is compatible with most VS Code forks. For other IDEs, you can also run the Codex CLI in the IDE’s terminal.

## How do workspace permissions apply to Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app?

Yes. Managed workspaces can control Codex local use and Codex cloud tasks separately. Codex Local covers the CLI, IDE extension, and desktop workflows, while Codex Cloud covers delegated cloud tasks. Remote Control may also require workspace enablement or RBAC permission, and the device must allow discovery and control in ChatGPT desktop settings. For an in-depth guide to get your workspace up and running with Codex, please refer to our guide here: Enterprise Admin Guide

## Where can I find help troubleshooting Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app?

Refer to our platform guide if you run into issues using Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app. If you need additional help, contact us.

## How can I get access to Codex Enterprise Analytics?

Codex Enterprise Analytics is available to Enterprise workspaces with Codex enabled. To use the API, ask a workspace owner or admin to create a workspace-scoped Admin key with the codex.enterprise.analytics.read permission.

In Admin Console, select the correct ChatGPT workspace, open Credentials > Admin keys, and set Codex analytics API to Read. API Platform organization keys do not provide access to ChatGPT workspace analytics.

For setup and permissions, see: Managing Admin keys in Admin Console.

For endpoint details, see: Codex Enterprise Analytics API reference.

## Do ChatGPT related rate limits for file upload limits, image limits and voice caps apply to Codex?

ChatGPT file uploads, image generation, or voice have separate usage limits, reset periods, and banners. For example, if you see banners like “50 images in the last day”, “resets in 720 hours”, reach voice caps, or see upload-limit banners while uploading files in ChatGPT, those limits do not apply to Codex. For details on image and video limits and voice limits, see image & video generation limits and voice usage limits. For information about ChatGPT file upload limits and troubleshooting, see File Uploads FAQ. For information on the status of various ChatGPT services, including file uploads, refer to the OpenAI status page.

ChatGPT Voice used inside Work or Codex on desktop is metered separately, while tasks started through Voice use the same shared agentic pool as Work and Codex. Learn more.

## How do Codex referral invitations and banked resets work?

Eligible users may see Codex referral invitations in the profile menu. Personal plan users may see Invite a friend, and eligible Business workspace members may see Invite a coworker. The invitation dialog shows details for the current offer, such as the current reward, invite limits, expiration, and any recipient requirements that apply.

For some Plus and Pro promotions, a successful referral can add a banked Codex rate-limit reset. To use a banked reset, open the profile menu and select the usage summary showing the available reset count, such as 1 reset available.

Using a full banked reset refreshes your 5-hour and weekly Codex usage windows and changes your weekly reset date. Check Settings → Usage for your updated reset time.

Referral rewards vary by offer and plan. For current reward, limit, and eligibility details, see Invite friends and coworkers and Codex Referral Promotions.

## How can I create project instructions in Codex?

Use /init in the ChatGPT desktop app while using Codex to generate an AGENTS.md scaffold for the current project. This uses the same initialization workflow as the Codex CLI. For other commands, see App commands.

## What happens if I reach a usage limit while Codex is working?

If you reach a usage limit during an active turn, Codex can continue working on that turn, subject to fair-use limits. After that turn, check the Codex usage page or the limit banner for the options available on your plan, such as adding credits, applying an available reset, upgrading, or waiting for the limit to reset. For more details, see Codex usage limits.

## What happens to GPT-5.4 and GPT-5.4 mini in Codex?

On August 31, 2026, GPT-5.4 and GPT-5.4 mini will no longer be available in Codex when you sign in with your ChatGPT account.

- Replace GPT-5.4 with GPT-5.6 Terra.

- Replace GPT-5.4 mini with GPT-5.6 Luna.

- Update any workspace defaults, saved model settings, managed configurations, or automations before August 31.

This change does not affect the OpenAI API or using Codex with your own API key.

## Can Support reset my usage limits?

No. OpenAI Support does not reset ChatGPT or Codex usage limits. If you reach a limit, wait until it resets or use another available option shown in your account.

If you believe your usage was counted incorrectly, or access has not returned after the stated reset time, contact Support so we can investigate.

## How do one-time usage-limit resets work?

OpenAI may occasionally provide eligible users with a one-time reset of Codex or ChatGPT Work usage limits. Eligibility, the limits affected, and any redemption or expiration requirements may vary by offer. Future resets are not guaranteed.

An automatic reset is applied directly to the usage limits covered by the announcement. The automatic reset itself is not saved for later. Usage after it is applied counts toward your refreshed allowance. Some offers may also include a separate banked reset. If you receive one, check your account or the offer for redemption and expiration details.

We do not provide an additional reset, credit, refund, or other compensation solely because you were not eligible for a one-time reset, did not notice a correctly applied reset, or did not use a banked reset before its stated expiration.

Contact Support if your usage appears incorrect, access has not returned after the stated reset time, or you believe a reset you were eligible to receive was not applied as described.

## Why does Codex fail to start with approval_policy = "untrusted"?

Codex no longer supports the untrusted approval policy. If your configuration still uses it, Codex may fail to start with this error: approval_policy = "untrusted" is no longer supported; remove this setting.

This change applies to Codex CLI version 0.149.0 and later, the Codex desktop app version 26.818.31338 and later on macOS, Windows, and Linux, and the Codex VS Code extension version 26.818.31338 and later.

To fix the issue, open ~/.codex/config.toml on macOS or Linux, or %USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml on Windows, and remove approval_policy = "untrusted".

Also check active profiles, organization-managed configuration, allowed_approval_policies, and commands using --ask-for-approval untrusted for references to the unsupported policy.

For a restrictive alternative, set sandbox_mode = "read-only" and approval_policy = "on-request".

Restart Codex after updating your configuration. The project-level trust_level = "untrusted" setting is separate and remains supported.
